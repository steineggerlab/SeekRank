# SeekRank
Rank homologous protein sequences based on a regressor trained on experimental measures

## SeekRank.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook for searching homologous proteins with good predicted experimental measures from metagenomic database.
It will train a regressor on protein Language Model embeddings and experimental measures,
search for homologous proteins in a metagenomic database, and rank them based on the regressor.
Please see the notebook for more details.

## FacebookEmbeddings.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook used for producing results in the paper below.
